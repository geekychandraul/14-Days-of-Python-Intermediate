# 🚀 14 Days of Python Intermediate

Welcome to **Phase 2** of your Python journey!

If you have conquered the basics (Variables, Loops, Functions), this course is designed to turn you into a **Professional Developer**. Here, we move away from simple scripts and start building real-world applications, working with files, APIs, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

> **Pre-requisite:** You must have completed [14-Days-of-Python-Basics](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/14-Days-of-Python-Basics) or have equivalent knowledge.

## 🛠️ How to Use the `resources` Folder

Some lessons (like Day 03 and Day 04) require external files to read data from.

* We have placed all necessary files in the `resources/` folder.
* In your code, you will access them like this:
```python
with open("resources/sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

```



## 🕵️ Stuck? Check `solutions`

Every daily notebook contains 5 Levels of Activities.

* Try to solve them yourself first!
* If you get stuck, open the corresponding file in the `solutions/` folder to see the answer key.

## 🚀 What's Next?

Completing this course means you are no longer a beginner. You are a **Python Developer**.
From here, you can specialize in:

* **Web Development:** Django or FastAPI
* **Data Science:** Pandas & NumPy
* **AI/ML:** PyTorch or TensorFlow

**Happy Coding! 🐍**
